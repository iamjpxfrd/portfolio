// wrapped paragraph the browser could break anywhere it liked.
//
// A longer supporting paragraph used to follow this and was cut: it restated
// the hook at four times the length, and in a viewport-height panel that copy
// was the difference between the menu fitting and the menu scrolling. The
// same claims survive in `profile.bio`, which the footer sets at the point a
// visitor has actually seen the work.
